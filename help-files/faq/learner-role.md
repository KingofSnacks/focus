What is the difference between Request Credit, External Files, and Submit Proof of Completion?
- Request Credit:
  - this is used to request credit for a training taken externally that matches up with a course in the Training Catalog; it will not reflect in compliance reports if those need to be run or are required for the course. We have temporarily turned off this feature since it was creating confusion with outside/external training record documentation.
- External Files:
  - this function allows the Learner to upload licenses, degrees, etc. This is not to be used for training certificates or completion certificates for training. They will not show up in compliance reports.
- Submit Proof of Completion:
  - Preferred method of adding training to your record.
    - After registering for and taking a training, you may submit your Proof of Completion using this function to have it marked as complete and added to your training record. This is for courses that are not managed by a Training Specialist or the Training Section; they will add the training to your record

Who can add Education/License/Certificate to a Learner’s Profile?
- A Learner can request to add items via the External Files upload.

How do I submit a training request and/or add external training to my record?
- Trainings on the Training Schedule / in the Catalog
  - From the Learner’s Dashboard, go to View Course Catalog and browse or search for the course you wish to enroll and add to your cart.
  - Fill out the Course Request Form, confirm your request.
